                <p>Incentives to student Innovators and Start-ups for exposure and participation in innovation/start-up related programmes at national and international arena</p>

                <p>SSIP is trying to develop a grassroots level culture to harness creative potential of youth across academia in the state. Significant number of teams across domains and universities have demonstrated huge potential through their innovation and start-ups. Many of them are also participating in various national and international programmes to demonstrate their work or explore for further value addition. Various open innovation initiatives, boot camps, demo days, accelerators, incubators, hackathons, awards and competitions are happening at national and internal stages round the years. It has been noticed that many of our SSIP grantees and other student innovators and start-ups are actively taking part in such platforms. In the SSIP policy, a clear mandate is given to create holistic end to end ecosystem for student start-ups. Early exposure and validation for any innovator and start-ups in their journey plays critical role in widening their vison and put their skills towards right orientation. Hence itâ€™s imperative that, we also work for supporting potential teams to participate in other ecosystems and bring back experience, achievement and insights which will laterally help others in our own ecosystem in Gujarat. Generally, such programmes have basic registration fees and the teams has to manage the travel and some logistic costs associated with it. It is recommended that SSIP cell at Education department can supports some of the outstanding teams for the same. A process like below can be put in place which will ensure that meritorious teams are supported for the cause.</p>

                <p>I-Hub and SSIP Cell at Education department will develop specific programmes with respect to above stakeholders and deliver round the year. We intend to develop strong culture at grassroots and hence building capacity of all stakeholders is imperative. Dedicated team at I-Hub will make strategy in consultation with expert organisations and individuals, develop the modules and execute in time bound manner. SSIP Cell at Education department will allocate annual resources for the above programs. Stakeholders across the value chain will be enabled with knowledge, tools and necessary exposure so that they can implement the mandate of SSIP policy in sustainable manner. Our goal is to develop internal capacity of all institutions in academia so that they develop processes and ecosystems at their place which can effectively harness creative pursuit of the youth. The SSIP Sakshyam initiative will also collaborate with various knowledge resource organisations while delivering the training.</p>

                <h4 style="color: #ff2c57">State level expert committee and Evaluation</h4><br>
                <p>This committee will comprise experts from Incubators, Accelerators, Academia, Industry, Innovation Promotion Organizations and members from SSIP Cell. Teams of innovators, student start-ups who have been short listed to participate in such reputed national and internal initiatives have to apply through SSIP web portal. Periodically the applications can be reviewed by this expert committee and check the credibility/worthiness of SSIP support for the applicant. As some of the national and internal competitions are technical in nature, the experts from the start-up ecosystem present in the above committee can give suitable advice.</p>
