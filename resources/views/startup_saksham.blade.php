                <p>I-Hub and SSIP Cell at Education department will develop specific programmes with respect to above stakeholders and deliver round the year. We intend to develop strong culture at grassroots and hence building capacity of all stakeholders is imperative. Dedicated team at I-Hub will make strategy in consultation with expert organisations and individuals, develop the modules and execute in time bound manner. SSIP Cell at Education department will allocate annual resources for the above programs. Stakeholders across the value chain will be enabled with knowledge, tools and necessary exposure so that they can implement the mandate of SSIP policy in sustainable manner. Our goal is to develop internal capacity of all institutions in academia so that they develop processes and ecosystems at their place which can effectively harness creative pursuit of the youth. The SSIP Sakshyam initiative will also collaborate with various knowledge resource organisations while delivering the training.</p>
