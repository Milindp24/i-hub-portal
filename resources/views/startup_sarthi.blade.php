                <b>Broadly the Start-up Sathi Programme will cater to beneficiaries in three layers as below:</b>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Proof of Concept Design Stage/Ideation Phase</li>
                    <li>Incubation Stage/Product Market Fit Segment</li>
                    <li>Growth Stage Start-ups</li>
                </ol>

                <b>Broadly the Start-up Sathi/Mentors will be empanelled in three segments.</b><br>

                <p><span class="head">1. Start-up Sathi : Advisor</span>
                Such person in general has a depth of knowledge, experience, and connections. This is a person who has been publicly acclaimed for their success and who is willing to impart their wisdom and advice on people who are at an earlier stage of their career.</p>

                <p><span class="head">2. Start-up Sathi : Expert</span>
                “Expert” mentors can help the start-up/innovator solve a very specific problem it is facing. This is the type of mentor start-up turn to when it need deep knowledge on a particular subject. Start-up Sathi may vary depending upon Objectives of mentoring, Levels of time commitment (2/4/8 hours per month) to the mentees,Types of resource commitments (advice/contacts/ funds/ infrastructure etc.) to the mentoring process.</p>

                <p><span class="head">3. Start-up Sathi : Peer</span>
                Such persons are someone else who is better suited to give you advice on more day-to-day operational concerns. Generally a Peer mentor is someone who has been in mentee’s shoes quite recently. They’re on a similar path, just a few steps ahead of mentee.In contrast with Advisors, generally the Peer mentors do not tell the mentee precisely what the start-up/innovator need to do. Instead, they tell it how they approached a problem or how they’d do something differently if they could do it over again. But these lessons are extremely helpful and can definitely save start-up a lot of time.</p>
